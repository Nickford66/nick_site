        <h2>Barcley Johnson</h2>
        <p>Barcley Johnson is an instructor of management at Western Michigan University's Haworth College of Business.</p>
        <p>He is a graduate of the Haworth College of Business, and attended graduate school at the University of Notre Dame, eventually earning an MBA with honors from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. He joined the WMU Department of Management faculty in 1998 at the WMU-Southwest regional location, and has since become a valuable asset to the business college.</p>
        <p>Johnson's educational focus and research include the study of failure, venture and angel capital, new venture valuation methodology and all things entrepreneurial. He is heavily involved in community activities such as the Rotary and St. Joseph-Benton Harbor Cornerstone Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>Johnson's most significant business educational experience came early in his career working at the City Limits Dairy Farm owned by his grandparents—with hands on learning from auctions to the laws of the harvest.</p>
        <p>Johnson owns several businesses including a consulting corporation.</p>
