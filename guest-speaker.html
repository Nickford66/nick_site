        <h2>Kane Greer - Finding Comfort in the Uncomfortable</h2>
        <p>
            Kane is a respected cybersecurity specialist serving the City of South Bend whose career is built on a profound commitment to learning and growth. His journey began when he earned his Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity from Western Michigan University. As a founding member and former president of the Bronco Cybersecurity Club, he nurtured a vibrant community of security enthusiasts on campus. His role as Team Lead for Team TechNext, an initiative devoted to connecting alumni with emerging technology talents, further reflects his heartfelt belief in the power of shared knowledge. </p>

            <p>Kane’s leadership is a personal testament to the transformative nature of perseverance and mentorship. An early setback, when he faced rejection from Western Michigan University, became the catalyst for his relentless pursuit of excellence. That experience now inspires him to give back, guiding and empowering the next generation of cybersecurity professionals with warmth and unwavering dedication.        </p>
